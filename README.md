# SystemArchitectureProblems

This project is intended to allow quick optimization to solve common system architecture problems. There are 6 common system architecture problems: 
1) Down-selecting 
2) Combining 
3) Connecting 
4) Assigning 
5) Partitioning 
6) Permuting

System architecture problem is built on MOEAFramework (v2.11) available at http://moeaframework.org. This allows the user to create system architecture problems and apply a myraid of algorithms to conduct single-objective or multiobjective optimization. MOEAFramework also has tools to conduct sensitivity analysis
